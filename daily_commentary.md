1. **Z5 → 2027-12-17** - ~13.966MM DV01 (KRW)

**EUR** — The largest structure in today's EUR swap activity is the 6M → 2027-03-31, concentrated in the 0-2Y bucket with a significant ~81k DV01, suggesting a strong focus on short-term liability management or hedging against near-term rate movements. This concentration in the front end, coupled with the secondary focus on the 3-5Y bucket with ~44k DV01, indicates a strategic positioning that balances immediate rate exposure with medium-term rate expectations, possibly reflecting a cautious outlook on the ECB's policy trajectory. The absence of activity in the 0-9M bucket and the maturities around 2027 and 2031 suggest a deliberate avoidance of ultra-short-term volatility, aligning with.

**KRW** — The KRW swap market on October 2, 2025, was dominated by a single trade in the Z5 structure maturing on December 17, 2027, with a substantial DV01 of approximately 13. 966MM USD, indicating a concentrated focus on the short end of the curve within the 0-2Y tenor bucket. This concentration suggests a strategic emphasis on managing near-term liabilities or exploiting relative value opportunities in the short-term rates environment, potentially reflecting expectations of rate movements or hedging against short-term interest rate volatility.

**MXN** — The MXN swap market on October 2, 2025, saw a singular trade with a substantial notional of approximately 494. 7 million, indicating a focused and potentially strategic positioning rather than broad market activity. This concentration in a single trade suggests a targeted liability management or hedging strategy, likely in the belly of the curve, where DV01 sensitivity is optimized for managing interest rate exposure.
