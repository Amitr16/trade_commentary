**EUR** — The largest structure in today's EUR swap activity is the 6M → 2027-03-31, concentrated in the 0-2Y bucket with a significant ~81k DV01, suggesting a strong focus on short-term liability management or hedging against near-term rate volatility. This concentration in the front end, coupled with the secondary focus on the 3-5Y bucket (~44k DV01) through the 6M → 2031-03-31 structure, indicates a strategic positioning that balances immediate rate exposure with medium-term rate expectations, possibly reflecting a view on flattening yield curves or capturing relative value in the mid-curve. The absence of activity in the 0-9M bucket and the clustering of matur.

**KRW** — The KRW swap market on October 2, 2025, was dominated by a single trade in the Z5 structure maturing on December 17, 2027, with a substantial DV01 of approximately 13. 966MM USD, indicating a concentrated focus on the short end of the curve within the 0-2Y tenor bucket. This activity suggests a strategic emphasis on managing short-term liabilities or exploiting relative value opportunities in the near-term maturities, consistent with a market positioning that anticipates potential shifts in short-term interest rates.

**MXN** — The MXN swap market on October 2, 2025, saw a singular trade with a substantial notional of approximately 494. 7 million, indicating a concentrated interest in a specific tenor, likely reflecting a strategic liability management or hedging decision. Given the absence of multiple trades, the activity suggests a targeted approach, possibly in the belly of the curve, where DV01 sensitivity is typically optimized for balancing duration risk and yield enhancement.
